# Blockly for Airsoft Explosive Language [ASEL]

[Airsoft Explosive Language [ASEL]](https://github.com/jonpas/ASEL) is a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for easy creation of programs designed to simulate a sports explosive device in an [Airsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airsoft) setting.

Google's Blockly is a web-based, visual programming editor. Users can drag
blocks together to build programs. All code is free and open source. This is a fork of [Blockly](https://github.com/google/blockly).

This projects adds support for ASEL to Blockly, with all language concepts that are also available in the ASEL text language. **Generation is not yet supported.**
